#### Note: The member registration for the ICC (volunteers) are for students who are incoming 6th grade or above.
If you are younger, you can still sign up for courses (and we recommend you do so!) but would advise against joining as a member until you're a bit older. We apologize for the inconvenience. However, if you still want to join, shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:theinspirecodingclub@gmail.com">admin@irvinecoding.club</a> and we'll get back to you!
