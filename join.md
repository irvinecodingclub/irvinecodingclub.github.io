# Join the Irvine Coding Club

The Irvine Coding Club is currently accepting volunteering for 
 - TAing for courses
 - Creating new courses/workshops/tournaments
 - Fundraisers (virtual and in-person)
 - Upgrading the website/adding new features
 - Anything else (legitimate) you can think of

The ICC is a PVSA certifying organization which means you will be compensated with Volunteer Hours for your hard work.

#### Note: The member registration for the ICC (volunteers) are for students who are incoming 6th grade or above.
