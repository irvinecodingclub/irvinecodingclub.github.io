The Inspire Coding Club is currently accepting volunteering for 
 - TAing for courses
 - Creating new courses/workshops/tournaments

**Joining the ICC is simple: all you have to do is join the Discord server! Upon member verification, you will be considered a member of the ICC.**

#### Note: The member registration for the ICC (volunteers) is for students who are incoming 6th grade or above.
If you are younger, you can still enroll in courses (and we recommend you do so!) but would advise against joining as a member until you're a bit older. We apologize for the inconvenience. However, if you still want to join, shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:theinspirecodingclub@gmail.com">theinspirecodingclub@gmail.com</a> and we'll get back to you!
