For young students, [bebras](https://www.bebras.org/) is a good way to learn computational thinking.   
[USA Computing Olympiad](https://usaco.org) and [Canadian Computing Competition](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html) are two major competition for high school students in USA and Cananda.

There are other prominent algorithmic programming contests, such as the [American Computer Science League](https://www.acsl.org/),  Topcoder, CodeForces, Google Code Jam and Google Kickstart.

[CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) and [picoCTF from CMU](https://picoctf.org/) are two national highly ranked coding competition focusing on computer security.

There are also several California (and online now) coding competitions, including [High School Programming Contest](https://www.cpp.edu/~hspc/), [Harker Programming Invitational](https://web.harker.org/programming/), [Girls Programming League (GPL)](https://www.girlsprogrammingleague.org/).

Other software development competitions are [congressional app challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/), [LA hacks](https://lahacks.com/home) and [first robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).

A list of coding competition is maintained [here](https://clist.by/).

Irvine Coding Club helps organize students form teams to attend team competitions and helps students prepare for individual competitions. If you are interested in these coding competitions (especially for ACSL 2021-2022 season), please fill [this survey form](https://forms.gle/G7gAhVgqa3RVUQZ98)  if you are interested in attending ACSL competition 2021-2022  season.
