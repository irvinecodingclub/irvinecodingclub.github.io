[American Computer Science League (ACSL)](https://www.acsl.org/) organizes computer science and programming contests for K-12 students.
The 2020-2021 school year will be our 43rd year of continuous operation. Last year, about 500 teams in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia participated.



ACSL offers multiple divisions, providing an appropriate challenge for students of varying ages and abilities. An unlimited number of students from a team may compete in each contest.

Each season is divided into four contests, testing students on fundamental concepts in computer science, ranging from Number Systems to Boolean Algebra to Digital Electronics. Each contest also includes a problem to solve by programming.

## Registering Teams
Students compete as teams in ACSL contests. A team consists of a minimum of three students and can include an unlimited number of students from your school or organization. There can be only one team per division per school or organization. Please visit the Divisions page for information on various divisions and choose the division(s) that is(are) suitable for your students.


## Divisions

ACSL offers five divisions, Senior, Intermediate, Junior, Classroom, or Elementary, providing an appropriate challenge for students of varying ages and abilities.

An unlimited number of students from a school may compete in a division. At registration, the advisor can select whether the top 3 scores or the top 5 scores will make up the team score. These top scores may come from different students each contest. A school can register just one team per division.


* **SENIOR DIVISION**: Best for high school students with programming experience, especially those taking AP Computer Science.
* **INTERMEDIATE DIVISION**: Best for high school students with little or no programming experience and for advanced junior high students.
* **JUNIOR DIVISION**: Best for junior high and middle school students with no previous programming experience. No student beyond grade 9 may compete in the Junior Division.
* **ELEMENTARY DIVISION** : Open to students in grades 3 - 6.
* **CLASSROOM DIVISION** : Open to students in all grades. Ideally suited for students taking AP Computer Science Principles, and other computer science classes without a major programming component.
