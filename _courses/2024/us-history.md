# Course Description

This course in early US history will cover a broad range of history, through the early stages of European colonization to the Civil War. Students will have the opportunity to participate in multiple debate sessions throughout the course and will also compose an essay through the analysis of historical documents.

Intro to US History is a **fast-paced** course (it covers all topics of California 8th grade US History, the last US History class before AP US History, in 4 weeks). This means that students should expect homework which includes leftover material from class as well as other projects and notetakers that are assigned via Google Classroom. While the amount of time it takes to complete homework varies from student to student, most students from last year reported around 45 minutes of homework per week.

Students are expected to keep up with course material. US History is **information-dense**, and students often choose to study on their own time to fully understand the material.
