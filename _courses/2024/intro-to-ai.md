# Course Description

Even with prior programming experience, it may seem daunting to branch out into the field of artificial intelligence. This course introduces and thoroughly explains these concepts in a completely beginner-friendly fashion without wasting time, via a programmatic pseudo-code approach. The course covers many applications of AI, from search algorithms, neural networks, and more!

# Who Is This Course For?

This course is best suited for 5th-10th grade students. It is targeted towards students with at least beginner-level coding profieincy. See course prerequisites for more information.

# Course Prerequisites

- Prior coding experience is **strongly recommended**, preferably in Python
  - You should be able to read Python code. Although you do not need to know Python to learn the concepts from this course, demonstrations will be done in Python, which will not be covered in this course
- A Google account for Google Colaboratory

# Course Dates

This course runs for 5 weeks weekly, starting on Saturday, July 13, and ending on Saturday, August 10. Classes are held online from 9-10am via Zoom.

# Syllabus

### Lesson 1: Search Algorithms

In this lesson, we will briefly explain what AI actually is and will cover the basics of search alogorithms. Students will learn how to use AI to navigate mazes, as well as potential challenges the AI might face.

### Lesson 2: Machine Learning

Machine learning is one of the most powerful ways to train an AI. Students will learn how to classify a given input into various labels through AI.

### Lesson 3: Optimization

Students will learn the importance of optimizing their AI models. Various methods on how to do so will be introduced as well as potential challenges which come with overfitting.
