# Syllabus

### Lesson 1:

Learn the basic fundamentals of music as we explore the applications of note values, time signatures, and key signatures. This first lesson will familiarize students with how to read sheet music and scales of every key signature.

### Lesson 2:

Building off of reading and understanding notes and rhythms, this lesson will explain melodies and harmonies, applying these basic concepts to develop different types of chords. Students will be able to read chords, craft their own, as well as add adjustments and inversions.

### Lesson 3:

This lesson puts together conceptual skills from the previous units to explore changing tempos, style, and articulation. These topics cover how to add emotion to music and playing.

### Lesson 4:

Students will learn patterns in music and apply a simple 5 finger pattern to play any scale. This lesson will also cover music history as we dive into musical periods including Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Contemporary.

### Lesson 5:

This final lesson will review all of the concepts we have learned this summer, applying students' knowledge to a variety of activities, practice problems, and games.
