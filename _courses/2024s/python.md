# Course Description

To many, programming can seem daunting and difficult at first. This course aims to introduce one of the most popular languages, Python, in a simple but straightforward way. Glimpse into the world of computer science, from variables to functions. This course on the basics of Python will consist of eight lessons, covering variables and types (Weeks 1 and 2), flow control (3 and 4), loops (5 and 6), and simple turtle graphics (7 and 8). The course is split half into beginner python lessons and half into intermediate.

# Who Is This Course For?

This course is for anyone interested in Python and computer science, though recommended for students in grades 3-8. No prior coding experience or knowledge is needed! See course prerequisites for more information.

### Course Prerequisites

- A working device, such as a computer
  - The course will be very hands-on, meaning that we will be coding in class a lot

# Course Dates

This course runs twice a week for 4 weeks, starting on Wednesday, June 26, and ending on Friday, July 19. Classes are held online from 3:30-4:30pm via Zoom.

# Syllabus

### Lesson 1: Variables

A quick introduction to programming in general while exploring variables, data types, and algebraic expressions for students to code their first program!

### Lesson 2: Logic & Arrays

We'll be exploring boolean expressions as well as how to take user input. The lesson will also cover casting, basic String operations, and arrays.

### Lesson 3: Conditional Statements

This lesson will explore conditional statements (if...else...) as students start to make more complicated logic-based programs.

### Lesson 4: Review

This will be the last lesson for our beginner-level Python course as we do a quick review and lead students through a mini project.

### Lesson 5: Lists & Loops

This will be the first lesson for our intermediate-level Python course. Students who have some programming knowledge already may skip the first four lessons and join here (although, it's recommended to come to every lesson since we will be building off of each one!). Students who took the first 4 lessons will be sufficiently prepared for this intermediate-level course as we explore lists and loops.

### Lesson 6: Challenges

Building off of loops, we will be going over flow control and functions while presenting some challenging problems for students.

### Lesson 7: Python Turtles I

As we finish going over the basics in Python, we will now start teaching Python Turtle graphics for students to draw with code!

### Lesson 8: Python Turtles II

This will be our final lesson as we keep learning about Python Turtles and answer any questions about Python or coding in general.
