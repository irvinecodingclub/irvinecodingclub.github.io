This is a intermediate level Python class. Students should have a prior knowledge of basic Python, understanding Python topics like loops, variables, functions, sets, and dictionaries. We will go through questions in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).



# Lesson 1 Introduction

In this course, we will use Python program to solve mathematical problems. We will introduce various algorithms in Computer Science which can be used to deal with math problems. After learning this course, students will be able to practise by themselves to solve problems in Project Euler.


### Project Euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

###### Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

###### Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

###### Problem 4 Largest palindrome product

###### Problem 76: Number of ways a number can be written as a sum of at least two positive integers

###### Problem 12: Highly divisible triangular number

# Lesson 2 Prime number

#### How to check if a number is a Prime ?

###### Problem 3: Largest prime factor

#### Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm

###### Problem 10: Summation of primes
###### Problem 7:  10001st prime
###### Problem 87: Prime power triplets

# Lesson 3  LCM and GCD: the Euclidean Algorithm

###### Problem 5: Smallest multiple
###### Problem 350: Constraining the least greatest and the greatest least


# Lesson 4 Counting

###### Problem 114 Count the ways a row measuring fifty units in length could be filled with blocks three units long
###### Problem 15 Lattice paths
###### Problem 53: How many values of C(n,r), for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, exceed one-million?

# Lesson 5  Number Tricks

###### Problem 12 Highly divisible triangular numbers
