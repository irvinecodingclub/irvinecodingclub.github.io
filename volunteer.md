# Our Mission

The Inspire Coding Club (ICC) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization run by students. It is a note to our past selves; our ultimate goal is to increase educational opportunities through the offering of classes of which we never had the opportunities to take. In this way, the ICC reflects upon its volunteers and their individual experiences as each course is led with strong passion through effective altruism. Although we started out with a primary focus on STEM, our catalogue has since branched out much further, having included topics such as animation, debate, music, and more!

The Inspire Coding Club is a [Presidential Volunteer Service Award](https://www.presidentialserviceawards.gov/) Certifying Organization.

# Ways to contribute!

#### Become a Lecturer

ICC lecturers lead our classes. Lecturers will also actively participate in writing class materials. Lecturers can create courses out of any approved topic or work with other lecturers to further the material of existing classes.

#### Become a Teacher Assistant

Anyone is welcome to help our students in courses, answer students&#39; questions, and/or help with discussion sessions in breakout rooms. Little to no experience with the subject is generally required unless specifically stated and both long/short term opportunities exist. This is one of the best ways to get volunteer hours, get to know lecturers, and possibly learn some new material along the way!

<!-- #### Become a Shelter Volunteer

The Inspire Coding Club is proud to proclaim that we have partnered with at-risk and homeless shelters to provide our material to those who may be deprived of such an opportunity otherwise. No coding experience is needed, and managing students/troubleshooting with them is the largest part of the opportunity. -->

#### Apply as a Branch Director

If you are passionate about coordinating/teaching academic subjects to students at your school (or former schools) and are interested in doing so, you are welcome (and encouraged) to apply to be an [ICC branch]({{ site.baseurl }}/branches) director for your school (or your community). Message us on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/join) for more details.

#### Just Hang Out!

Cultivate your passions and talk to others with similar interests! Our ultimate goal is to instill a sense of enthusiasm among students and empower them to have one if they don't already.
